// I want a component for balance, add transaction,spend points, and transactions

// If connected to an api I would have mapped the payers to props for add transacrion and then used the props to populate the dropdown list instead or writing each payer individually  


If I were to do this over I would have changed my approach to solving by having an actual Backend/API instead of rely on local storage. However, it was fun to use and learn about in the process. A very good solution for small projects like this, but definitely no preferable in the long term. 

// i could also refactor the spending calculations function into a bunch of smaller function to keep the code tight and adhere to the single responsibility principle
